# `CS50` intorduction Artificial Intelligence


##### "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as artificial general intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called artificial biological intelligence (ABI). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[3] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving"."

###### note by `sikai lu`

* ### [search](lectures/lecture0.md)
finding a solution to a problem, grab a cat to catch a mouse. or figuring the next move when playing a game.

* ### [knowledge](lectures/lecture1.md)
represent information and drawing inferences to it.

* ### [uncertainty](lectures/lecture2.md)
dealing with uncertain event using probability. predict the future by making it.

* ### [optimization](lectures/lecture3.md)
not just find the correct solution, find the it with the best way.

* ### [learning](lectures/lecture4.md)
Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience. or being able to walk based on past fails.

* ### [neural networks](lectures/lecture5.md)
A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.

* ### [language](lectures/lecture6.md)
the abilities to read natural language. which is produced and understood by human, it opens a new door into communication.
